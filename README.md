# 🧬 Bioinformatics Portfolio

This is my computational biology portfolio. This page highlights projects where I explore real RNA-seq data, build pipelines, analyze gene expression in cancer, and develop programs to automate scientific data visualization.

## 🔁 Circadian Gene Dysregulation in Pancreatic Cancer

📂 [View project folder](./circadian-dysregulation-tcga-paad)  
📒 [View notebook](./circadian-dysregulation-tcga-paad/CircadianGeneDisruption_InCancer.ipynb)

- Investigated 32 experimentally validated circadian genes using TCGA-PAAD RNA-seq data
- Performed Welch’s t-test + FDR correction to find significant expression differences
- Visualized results with a volcano plot

✅ **Significant genes found**:
- **RAB24** (downregulated)
- **WDR75** (upregulated)

## 🩺 Breast Cancer Gene Expression Subtypes

📂 [View project folder](./breast-cancer-gene-expression)  
📒 [View notebook](./breast-cancer-gene-expression/Breast_Cancer_Gene_Expression.ipynb)

- Identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between breast cancer subtypes
- Used phenotype metadata to group and compare samples
- Functional enrichment revealed major differences in:
  - Mitotic activity
  - Lipid metabolism
  - ECM organization

🖼️ Includes enrichment plots for upregulated and downregulated DEGs
