# 🧬 Bioinformatics Portfolio

This is my computational biology portfolio. This page highlights projects where I explore real RNA-seq data, build pipelines, analyze gene expression in cancer, and develop programs to automate scientific data visualization.

## 🔁 Circadian Gene Dysregulation in Pancreatic Cancer

📂 [View project folder](./circadian-dysregulation-tcga-paad)  
📒 [View notebook](./circadian-dysregulation-tcga-paad/CircadianGeneDisruption_InCancer.ipynb)

- Investigated 32 experimentally validated circadian genes using TCGA-PAAD RNA-seq data
- Performed Welch’s t-test + FDR correction to find significant expression differences
- Visualized results with a volcano plot

✅ **Significant genes found**:
- **RAB24** (downregulated)
- **WDR75** (upregulated)
