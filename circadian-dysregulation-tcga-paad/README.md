# ðŸ§¬ Circadian Gene Dysregulation in Pancreatic Cancer

This project analyzes the expression of circadian genes in pancreatic adenocarcinoma (TCGA-PAAD) using RNA-seq data.

### ðŸ”¬ Key Methods
- Subset TCGA expression matrix to 32 experimentally validated circadian genes
- Match tumor vs. normal samples using phenotype metadata
- Welchâ€™s t-test for differential expression
- FDR correction and volcano plot

### ðŸ“ˆ Results
- 2 significantly dysregulated genes:
  - **RAB24**: downregulated in tumors
  - **WDR75**: upregulated in tumors
